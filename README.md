# MahonFitting v2.0
<!--toc-->

## Introduction

This routine performs linear regressions to a set of measurement that have uncertainties in both axes, which we subsequently call *x* and *y*. The regression is based on the approach by Mahon (1996) and is the same regression as used by York (1969), however, with the corrected calculation for the uncertainties. The code presented here accompanies the publication of Trappitsch et al. (2018). If you want, please cite Trappitsch et al. (2018) as a reference for pointing at this tool.

The original program has been reduced to only the class Mahon (without the GUI), which performs the calculations.

## Usage
### Preparing your data set
Mahon requires a dataframe as a parameter. The column format must be:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|    x     |   x unc 	|    y     |   y unc  |   corr   |

where:
- [x ] are the x values 
- [x unc] are the uncertainties for x
- [y] are the y values
- [y unc] are the uncertainties for y
- [corr] are the correlation values

The testfile that is provided comes from the dataset published in Mahon (1996) and can be used for validation.

### Attributes
  * slope: Slope
  * yinter: Y-Intercept
  * xinter: X-Intercept
  * slopeunc: Slope uncertainty
  * yinterunc: Y-Intercept uncertainty
  * xinterunc: X-Intercept uncertainty
  * MSWD: Mean Square Weighted Deviation

### Problems
Since the slope of the regression is calculated iteratively (see equation (9) in Mahon, 1996), there is a chance that the iterative process does not converge. In this case, the python routine stops after 10<sup>6</sup> iterations and will give you an error message such that you can see how well it converged and decide for yourself if it is acceptable or not. Please also have a look at the regression and see if it looks reasonable, check if the configuration that you want to have regressed is reasonable. If the problem consists, you find another problem, or have problems using this software, feel free to contact me.

## Required packages:
